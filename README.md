This is a basic packaging of the SuperSlicer Ubuntu build as a Flatpak

When releasing, please update `share/metainfo/io.github.supermerill.SuperSlicer.metainfo.xml`.

# Known Limitations

- Because the tarball was compiled with the intention of being run directly, the desktop integration menu is still enabled. This will not work.
- There's a few issues with rendering the MIME type icons for files.
